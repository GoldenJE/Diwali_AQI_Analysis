# Diwali_AQI_Analysis

**Introduction**

DIwali is the festival of lights and celebrated across the country. As this marks as an auspicious day for the people. It also comes along with some unpleasant effects on the Environment. People burst crackers during the Festival which leads to increase in air pollution causing High AQI and poor quality of air leading to airborne diseases and long term health effects. The pollution caused during this festival may be due to bursting of firecrackers but the magmitude of the pollution may be due to various parameters. The aim of this analysis is to consider factors as parameters affecting the magnitude of pollution by studying their relation with AQI.

**Data and Methods**

I have used dataset published by the Central Pollution Control Board.
CPCB is monitoring ambient air quality and noise levels during Deepawali day festival from past many years to assess the status of air & noise pollution levels in environment caused by burning of crackers. The main objective of monitoring ambient air quality and noise levels is to ensure compliance of the Honâ€™ble Supreme Court directions dated October 5, 1999 & September 27, 2001 and also to examine the status & trend of pollution over the years during Deepawali day festival.I have gathered Literacy rate, Population and GDP of the cities along with their AQI after the day of Diwali as the DIWALI celebration goes on for 2 days and the maximum AQI can be observed during that time. I will be looking into the relationship between the AQI and above factors and look into the factor which is strongly related to the AQI. The analysis will also include predicting the AQI with respect to the parameters above. By finding about the parameter which is strongly related to the AQI we can take measures which may help reduce the AQI levels given the high pollution levels in the country. For the analysis I will be carrying out Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression analysis using AQI as my predictand and Literacy rate, GDP, Population as my predictor.The dataset that I will be using consist of 14 cities AQI and other parameters.


**Results and Discussion**

Through regression it was observed that Literacy rate was negatively related to the AQI that is the city with higher literacy rate recorded a low Air Quality Index. GDP also had a negative relation with AQI which can be considered unusaul as I expected GDP to have a positive relation with the AQI as this considers the Purchasing power parity of the cities and i expected that a city with high GDP might end up bursting more firecrackers and thereby causing High AQI.
